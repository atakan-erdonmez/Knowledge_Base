## 🧱 Core Concepts First

### 📄 **Logs**: Messages your system/services write (e.g., login, ssh attempt, sudo usage, nginx error).

These logs need to be:

1. **Collected** → from files or services
    
2. **Processed** → filtered, formatted
    
3. **Stored** → saved in a searchable format
    
4. **Viewed/Alerted** → through a UI or alert system

| Tool          | What It Does                                                                                      | Role                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `syslog`      | Generic term for standard UNIX-style logging (not a tool)                                         | Logging format                   |
| `journald`    | Part of systemd. Collects system logs and stores in binary                                        | Default logger on modern systems |
| `rsyslog`     | A powerful log router. Takes logs from journald/files and sends them elsewhere                    | Log shipper                      |
| **Filebeat**  | Lightweight agent from Elastic. Reads log files and sends to another service (e.g., ELK, Graylog) | Log shipper                      |
| **Logrotate** | Not a logger — it rotates old logs to avoid disk bloat                                            | Log maintenance                  |
| **Promtail**  | Lightweight agent from Grafana Labs. Scrapes logs from local files and sends them to Loki.        | Log shipper                      |

| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Falco**      | Real-time detection of suspicious behavior using syscalls (via eBPF)        | Runtime threat detection |
| **auditd**     | Kernel-level logging of access to files, syscalls, etc. Very detailed       | Security audit trail     |
| **Lynis**      | One-time or scheduled audit of system security (permissions, configs, etc.) | Security scanner         |
| **RKHunter**   | Scans for known rootkits, trojans                                           | Malware scanner          |
| **Chkrootkit** | Similar to RKHunter                                                         | Malware scanner          |

## 🔄 Example: How They Work Together

### 💡Scenario: You want to monitor your server for attacks and logs

**Option A – Classic Stack:**

```
System (journald/syslog) → rsyslog → Graylog → [You view in web UI]      
			↘→ auditd/Falco → alerts                   
			↘→ Logwatch → daily summary
```

**Option B – Grafana Stack:**

```
journald/syslog → promtail/filebeat → Loki                           
						↘→ Falco → alerts                           
						↘→ Grafana → UI for logs + dashboards
```
