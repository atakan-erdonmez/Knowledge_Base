## 📦 1. What is **Elasticsearch**?

- A **search engine** designed for **log and text data**.
    
- Stores large volumes of logs and lets you search/filter them quickly.
    
- Part of the **Elastic Stack**.
    

---

## 🔺 2. What is **ELK Stack**?

> ELK = **Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana**

| Component         | Role                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Elasticsearch** | Stores and indexes logs         |
| **Logstash**      | Parses and transforms log data  |
| **Kibana**        | UI for searching and dashboards |

### Example:

- You send syslogs to **Logstash**
    
- It parses and sends them to **Elasticsearch**
    
- You view logs via **Kibana**
    

---

### ⚠️ Problem with ELK:

Elastic (the company) changed their license model to a **non-open-source** license after v7.x.

---

## 🔄 3. What is **OpenSearch**?

- A **fully open-source fork** of Elasticsearch + Kibana
    
- Maintained by **Amazon AWS**
    
- Same APIs and functionality
    
- Used in place of Elasticsearch by Graylog and others
    

### Summary:

|Tool|Origin|License|Still Open?|Works with Graylog?|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Elasticsearch|Elastic.co|Was Apache, now SSPL|❌ No (new versions)|❌ (v7.10 last supported)|
|**OpenSearch**|AWS|Apache 2.0|✅ Yes|✅ Yes (preferred)|

---

## 🧭 TL;DR

- **Elasticsearch** = powerful log search engine
    
- **ELK Stack** = Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana (full log pipeline)
    
- **OpenSearch** = open-source drop-in replacement for Elasticsearch
    
- **Graylog** uses **OpenSearch** to store/search logs (you don’t interact with it directly)
    

You can think of **OpenSearch** as the **log database behind the scenes**.
