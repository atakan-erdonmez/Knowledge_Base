# Elasticsearch

- A **search engine** designed for **log and text data**.
    
- Stores large volumes of logs and lets you search/filter them quickly.
    
- Part of the **Elastic Stack**.

# ELK Stack

> ELK = **Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana**

| Component         | Role                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Elasticsearch** | Stores and indexes logs         |
| **Logstash**      | Parses and transforms log data  |
| **Kibana**        | UI for searching and dashboards |

### Example:

- You send syslogs to **Logstash**
- It parses and sends them to **Elasticsearch**
- You view logs via **Kibana**

### Problem with ELK:

Elastic (the company) changed their license model to a **non-open-source** license after v7.x.

---

# OpenSearch
Also: [[OpenSearch]]

- A **fully open-source fork** of Elasticsearch + Kibana
- Maintained by Amazon [[AWS]]
- Same APIs and functionality
- Used in place of Elasticsearch by [[GrayLog]] and others

### Summary:

| Tool          | Origin     | License              | Still Open?         | Works with Graylog?      |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Elasticsearch | Elastic.co | Was Apache, now SSPL | ❌ No (new versions) | ❌ (v7.10 last supported) |
| OpenSearch    | AWS        | Apache 2.0           | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes (preferred)        |

## 🧭 TL;DR

- **Elasticsearch** = powerful log search engine

- **ELK Stack** = Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana (full log pipeline)

- **OpenSearch** = open-source drop-in replacement for Elasticsearch

- **Graylog** uses **OpenSearch** to store/search logs (you don’t interact with it directly)


You can think of **OpenSearch** as the **log database behind the scenes**.
